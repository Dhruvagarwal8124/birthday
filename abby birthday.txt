abby birthday


we went to JNC for a fest together, talked a lot and i used her as an arm rest the entire time. we started texting each other every now and then.
one day after a lot of thought i asked her out during the night, and got a yes. We wanted to go for a date to Ricos but it started raining so we resorted for the college cafeteria. Had a great time there, after talking about a lot of things we then went to have French fries. Which we did not get that day but i used that as an excuse for the second date.
we started meeting in the library a lot, then started the scooter rides. Found make out spots. got caught once no twice actually.

    -my pencil carving

    -love letter which also asks her to open the gift (try if you can animate the words by making it appear word by word on the letter)

    -slide puzzle which reveals a letter

    -anagram of notting hill (solve the picture to reach to your Present")   GOTNTIN LIHL
    
    -CLICKING THE WINE BOTTLE

    - ("I just _________ with you!!") riddle- find me in the game(" its what we all enjoy, also taken in the name of jesus, we're banned from a place that sells this, cause we were upto something sus")

    -a tiny keyboard when keys are pressed a certain note is played, an order can be given to play the notes and she can guess what song is played (the guess could be the answer to the next puzzle)

    -enter the date of our first date(maybe like a lock) clue"goof around with the tones to fill the blank"

    -riddle (something that is always with/on me, was once sprayed you too, marks the beginning of our love story, you know what would be your number 2) clue ("first date ka date important hain baby")
